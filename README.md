I am currently a software development engineer at Zaya Learning Labs since March 2020, with 1.2 years of total experience in fullstack development.

Before this, I had finished two internships, both fullstack; one at Red Hat, and the second one at Bots N' Brains. Got to dabble with the MEAN and MERN stacks.

Transitioning from a big company to a fast-paced startup was a challenging, as well as an exciting transition. I got to experience life at two different ends of the spectrum, whilst I was juggling my Masters in CS studies on the side.

I have a deep passion for web engineering, and love building beautiful, intuitive & pixel-perfect UIs.

I also like building and handling the backend side of things, even though my interests are mainly aligned towards the front-end, and I love solving challenging problems.

**Stuff I know:** HTML, CSS/SASS, Javascript/Typescript, Vue, Vuex, React, Redux, Angular, Node, Express, MongoDB, mySQL, GraphQL, Java and Python.

Aside from tech, I like playing guitar, reading, writing short stories and poems, traveling, staying fit, quantum physics and I am an avid practitioner and volunteer of Heartfulness.
