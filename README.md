A passionate frontend engineer - I started out as a fullstack intern, eventually transitioning into front-end, and have 4 years of experience.

Love building beautiful and intuitive UIs.

Well versed in Javascript and its frameworks/libraries such as Angular, React, Vue, state-management libraries such as Redux and Vuex and SSR frameworks such as Nuxt.

Currently learning Typescript from scratch again, and plan to learn Python, Django, Springboot, Redis & Kafka.

Aside from writing code, I like playing guitar, reading, writing short stories and poems, traveling, working out, quantum physics, binging Marvel/DC movies, anime/manga and I am an avid practitioner & volunteer of [Heartfulness Meditation](https://heartfulness.org/in/about-heartfulness/).
