A passionate front-end SDE at Zaya Learning Labs since March, with 2 years of total experience.

Started as a fullstack intern, eventually transitioning into front-end engineering.

I love bringing alive designs via the UIs I build, being obsessed with making them as close to the original as possible.

I'm always up for discussing anything software related, particularly anything that pertains to the front-end. 

**Stuff I know:** HTML, CSS/SASS/SCSS, Javascript/Typescript, Vue, Vuex, React, Redux, Angular, Node, Express, MongoDB, mySQL & GraphQL

Aside from writing code, I like playing guitar, reading, writing short stories and poems, traveling, working out, quantum physics, binging Marvel/DC movies, anime/manga and I am an avid practitioner & volunteer of [Heartfulness Meditation](https://heartfulness.org/in/about-heartfulness/).
