A passionate software development engineer at Zaya Learning Labs since March 2020, with 1.4 years of total experience, who loves building beautiful, intuitive & pixel-perfect user interfaces. I strive for perfection.

I also love working full-stack, even though my interests are aligned towards the front-end, and love solving challenging problems.

Previously, I worked as a fullstack intern; the first at Red Hat, and the second one at Bots N' Brains. 

Worked with the MEAN and MERN stacks + GraphQL, and now I'm building UIs with Vue & VueX.

Transitioning from a big company to a fast-paced startup was a challenging, as well as an exciting transition. I got to experience life at two different ends of the spectrum, whilst pursuing my Masters in CS on the side.

**Stuff I know:** HTML, CSS/SASS/SCSS, Javascript/Typescript, Vue, Vuex, React, Redux, Angular, Node, Express, MongoDB, mySQL, GraphQL & Java/C++.

Aside from writing code, I like playing guitar, reading, writing short stories and poems, traveling, staying fit, quantum physics/mechanics, binging Marvel/DC comics & movies, and I am an avid practitioner & volunteer of [Heartfulness Meditation](http://heartfulness.org/)
