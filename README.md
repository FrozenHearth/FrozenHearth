A passionate software development engineer(front-end) at Zaya Learning Labs since March, with 1 and a half years of total experience in fullstack development

I love bringing alive designs via the UIs I build, being obsessed with striving to make them pixel-perfect, while banging my head over the hackiness & weirdness of CSS.

Honestly, complex problems make me panicky, but I still love tackling & converting problems into code.

Have a hunger for learning & strive to improve myself everyday.

Always up to discuss anything web-related or music, Marvel/DC comics & movies and manga/anime. 

**Stuff I know:** HTML, CSS/SASS/SCSS, Javascript/Typescript, Vue, Vuex, React, Redux, Angular, Node, Express, MongoDB, mySQL & GraphQL

Aside from writing code, I like playing guitar, reading, writing short stories and poems, traveling, staying fit, quantum physics/mechanics, binging Marvel/DC comics & movies, and I am an avid practitioner & volunteer of [Heartfulness Meditation](https://heartfulness.org/in/about-heartfulness/)
