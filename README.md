A passionate software engineer, I started as a fullstack intern, eventually transitioning into front-end, and have 2 years of total experience.

Love building beautiful and intuitive user-interfaces.

Well versed in Javascript and its frameworks/libraries such as Angular, React, Vue, state-management libraries such as Redux and Vuex and SSR frameworks such as Nuxt.

I'm always up for discussing anything software related. 

**Stuff I know:** HTML, CSS/SASS/SCSS, Javascript/Typescript, Vue, Vuex, React, Redux, Angular, Node, Express, MongoDB, mySQL & GraphQL

Aside from writing code, I like playing guitar, reading, writing short stories and poems, traveling, working out, quantum physics, binging Marvel/DC movies, anime/manga and I am an avid practitioner & volunteer of [Heartfulness Meditation](https://heartfulness.org/in/about-heartfulness/).
