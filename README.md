A passionate Senior Frontend Engineer with almost 6 years of experience.

Love building incredible UIs.

Experienced in Javascript and its frameworks/libraries such as Angular, React, Vue, state-management libraries such as Redux, Vuex and frameworks such as Nuxt/Next. I also have experience using Node.js, Java, Python & Redis, along with Postgres & MongoDB.

**Things I'm planning to learn:** Kafka, Docker, AWS, Kubernetes, AI/ML [and filling my missing gaps in the backend](https://roadmap.sh/backend)

Aside from writing code, I like playing guitar, reading, writing short stories and poems, solo traveling, working out, quantum physics, space/black holes, anime/manga and I am an avid practitioner of [Heartfulness Meditation](https://heartfulness.org/in/about-heartfulness/).
